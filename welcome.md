# Welcome

Welcome to the new blog page of our project, YouCode.io. It's a website where you can find talks or tutorials on Youtube easily. We built it last summer with simple features, and we were happy with it until now...

## What's changed?

We are a bunch of engineering students. We love to learn by ourselves, so we are always looking for new projects. Why not build a new version of YouCode, with more advanced features? Why not build a whole new version with all the latest hype tech?

## YouCode V1

This is our baby:

- Angular based website
- Hosted On Google App Engine
- No possibility of adding a new Youtube channel without deploying the whole code
- No API
- Strange file name
- no DB, only JSON files
- No TLS
 
## YouCode V2

This is what you can expect from us with V2:
 
- Based on microservices and Docker
- Using HTTP/2 or gRPC

Maybe you'll think that some of the items are overpowered for our usecase, we honestly don't care ;-) We want to discover new things through this project.
 
## Don't miss our blog post!

For most of us, we don't have real engineer's skills into what we are building. We will be larning through our journey, and each one of us will be writing down our mistakes and choices, so that you'll be able to learn too! 

Stay tuned and don't forget to learn ;)
